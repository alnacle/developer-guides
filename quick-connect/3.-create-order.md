# 3. Create order

Once the fare is confirmed, you’re ready to use the _Flight Create Orders API_ to perform the actual booking. This API lets you log a reservation in the airlines’ systems and create a PNR, and returns a unique ID number and the reservation details. If you’re using an airline consolidator, the PNR will be automatically sent to the consolidator for ticket issuance. [Visit the Flight Create Orders documentation page](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-create-orders) for more details on this API.

Remember, you need to be able to issue a ticket to make bookings with our Flight Create Order API. To access the API in production, you need to either sign a contract with an airline consolidator or be accredited to issue tickets yourself.
