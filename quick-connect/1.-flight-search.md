# 1. Flight Search

The Flight Offers Search API starts the booking cycle with a search for the best fares. The API returns a list of the cheapest flights given a city/airport of departure, a city/airport of arrival, the number and type of passengers and travel dates. The results are complete with airline name and fares as well as additional information like bag allowance and pricing for additional baggage.
