## OpenJDK? Oracle JDK? help!

Despite the complexity of the Java ecosystem, it's important to understant that there is only one set of source code for the JDK released under GPL license and hosted at [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/). You can follow [these instructions](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/raw-file/tip/common/doc/building.html) to compile and generate your own JDK flavour.

Different vendors build the OpenJDK adding additional tools, utilities or branding elements, but never modifing the language. As result the vendor provides a new build with some unique vendor capabilities or certification processes.

There are many JDK implementations, but the most used ones are:

* [OpenJDK](http://jdk.java.net/). Oracle GPL license unbranded builds of the OpenJDK.
* [Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/). Branded builds from Oracle that could be used without cost.

There are more implementations like [Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/), [IBM JDK](https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/support/lifecycle/), [Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/overview/) or [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
