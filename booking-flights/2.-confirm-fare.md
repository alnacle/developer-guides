# 2. Confirm Fare

The availability and price of airfare fluctuate so it’s important to confirm before proceeding to book. This is especially true if time passes between the initial search and the decision to book, as fares are limited and there are thousands of bookings occurring every minute. During this step, you can also add ancillary products like extra bags or legroom.

Once a flight has been selected, you’ll need to confirm the availability and price of the fare. This is where the Flight Offers Price API comes in. This API returns the final fare price \(including taxes and fees\) of flights from the Flight Offers Search API as well as pricing for ancillary products and the payment information that will be needed to make the final booking. 

Visit the [Flight Offers Price documentation page](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-price) for more details on this API.
