# Testing Data Collection

Under `Test Environment` the APIs use the following data collections:

* [List of Origin and Destinations](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/data-collection/blob/master/data/flightsearch.md) for `Flight Inspiration Search` and `Flight Cheapest Date Search`
* [List of Origin and Destinations](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/data-collection/blob/master/data/ti.md) for `Flight Most [Booked|Traveled] Destinations` and `Flight Busiest Traveling Period`.
* The [following table](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/data-collection/blob/master/data/checkinlinks.md) contains a list of valid airlines for `Flight Check-in Links`.
* `Airport Nearest Relevant` & `Airport & City Search` contain data from United States, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany and India.
* `Airline Code Lookup` contains almost all airlines.
* The content of `Hotel Search` comes directly from the hotel providers, so the content might change dynamically. For your test, use big cities like `LON` \(London\) or `NYC` \(New-York\).
* `Hotel Ratings` offers 24 hotels in the test environment: 10 in London and 14 in New-York. You can find the list [here](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/data-collection/blob/master/data/hotelratings.md).
* The Points Of Interest API has data for the [following cities](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/data-collection/blob/master/data/pois.md) in test.
* The Artificial Intelligence APIs \(`Flight Choice Prediction`, `Flight Delay Prediction`, `Airport On-time Performance`, `Trip Purpose Prediction` and `AI-generated Photos`\) have no data restrictions in test.
