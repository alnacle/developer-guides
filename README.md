# Amadeus for Developers Guides

## Welcome!

This is the official Amadeus for Developer documentation reference, but there are more resources out there that might help you in your journey of using the APIs. Check them out!

* You can find all APIs reference and swaggers in our [API catalogue](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service). 
* Donâ€™t forget to stop by our [GitHub workspace](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/) where you can find tons of samples and prototypes to get inspiration, as well as the latest version of the SDKs.
* If you are a happy postman user, as we are, feel free to use the [Amadeus for Developers postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2672636/RWEcPfuJ).
