# Moving to production

## Requesting the production keys

Moving your application to Production Environment means requesting a **production key**, but don't be scared! The process is very straight forward:

1. [Sign in](https://developers.amadeus.com/login) to your account
2. Click on your username \(top right corner\)
3. Go to [My Self-Service Workspace](https://developers.amadeus.com/my-apps)
4. Select the application that you want to move to Production and click on `Get Production environment` button:

Moving to **production environment** involves 3 steps:

1. Information about you and your app
2. Payment information \(credit card or bank transfer\)
3. Signing the terms and conditions \(via _DocuSign_\)

Once you have completed the steps above, you will receive a copy of your contract by email.

At this point your application's status will show **pending**:

Once your application is validated you will be notified and the application's status will change to **live**:

> Please note that the process can take up to 72 hours for your first application. Additional applications will **not** require any waiting time.

Remember that once you reach the threshold of free transactions, you will automatically be billed on a monthly basis, for each transaction. You can easily manage and track your app usage in [My Self-Service Workspace](https://developers.amadeus.com/my-apps).

## Using the new production keys

Once you get your production key you will need to change your source code to:

* replace the base URL for your API calls to point

  to `https://api.amadeus.com` instead of `https://test.api.amadeus.com`

* change your `API key` and `API secret` to your new production keys 

If you are using our [SDKs](https://github.com/amadeus4dev), just initialise the client as follows:

```python
amadeus = Client(client_id='YOUR_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID',
                 client_secret='YOUR_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_SECRET',
                 hostname='production')
```

**Congrats**! ðŸŽ‰ Your application is ready to disrupt the travel industry!
